This project involved the development of PCFs (PowerApps Component Frameworks) for the Emirates Flight Training Academy (EFTA) in 2023. The components were designed to enhance and streamline various aspects of exam management, including creating multiple types of questions, viewing and managing the exam itself, and tracking student performance. These tools ensured a more efficient and user-friendly experience for both instructors and students.

'Question Maker' PCF, which enables the creation of various question types. These include:
•	Theory Questions: Allows for free text responses.
•	Multi-Choice Questions: Multiple answers can be selected.
•	Single-Choice Questions: Only one answer can be selected.
•	Date Questions: Requires a date as the answer.
•	Calculate Questions: Involves calculations.
•	Matching Questions: Pairs items together based on a relationship.
